          <h3>What is Clean Energy?</h3>
            <p>
                Clean energy refers to energy sources and technologies that have minimal negative impact on the environment and produce little to no greenhouse gas emissions. The primary goal of clean energy is to reduce environmental pollution and mitigate the effects of climate change. Clean energy sources are sustainable and renewable, meaning they can be naturally replenished and are not depleted when used. Some common examples of clean energy sources include:

            <h3>How Does Home Energy Use Impact the Environment?</h3>
            <p>
                All forms of electricity generation have an environmental impact on our air, water, and land, but it varies. Of the total energy consumed in the United States, about 40% is used to generate electricity, making electricity use an important part of each person’s environmental footprint. Home energy use can have various environmental impacts, primarily depending on the sources of energy used and the efficiency of energy consumption. Here are some ways in which home energy use affects the environment:
            </p>

              <button class="accordion">Greenhouse Gas Emissions</button>
              <div class="apanel">
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Fossil Fuels:</strong> If a home relies on fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, or oil for heating, cooking, or electricity, the combustion of these fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases contribute to climate change by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Energy Sources:</strong> The environmental impact of home energy use is closely linked to the sources of electricity. If electricity is primarily generated from fossil fuels, the associated emissions contribute to air pollution and climate change. In contrast, using electricity from renewable sources like solar or wind power reduces these environmental impacts.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Appliance Efficiency:</strong> The efficiency of home appliances and systems plays a significant role. Energy-efficient appliances and lighting consume less electricity, reducing the demand for power generation and associated environmental impacts.</li>
                  <li><strong>Insulation and HVAC Systems:</strong> Proper insulation and efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can reduce the overall energy consumption of a home.</li>

                <h3>Solar</h3>
                <p>Solar PV systems cost about $3 per watt installed. A 7,000 watt (7 kilowatt) system therefore costs about $21,000 to install. Such a system would provide 20 to 35 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, depending on climate, and could meet most of a household’s demand.</p>
                <p>Solar hot water systems can meet 50% of the hot water needs for a family of four and generally cost between $5,000 and $7,000 to install.</p>
                <p>The average household in the U.S. spends about $125 a month on an energy bill. If your system is robust enough to entirely cover your energy usage, you could see savings of up to $1,500 a year. While you will see immediate savings on your first power bill after installing a solar system, your overall net savings will become apparent after several years of use—after the savings on your power bill have paid for the upfront costs of the panels and installation.</p>

                <p>Small wind energy systems cost an average of $5 per 120 kilowatts to install. Purchasing and installing a system can range from $10,000 to $70,000, depending on local zoning, permitting, and utility interconnection costs.</p>

Most states have established “net metering” rules for customers who generate excess electricity through solar, wind, or other systems and feed it into the grid.</p>

          <p> Do you want to reduce your impact on the environment but aren't sure
          how to start? Here are some ways that you can make
          your home more friendly to the environment.
          <p>
          <h3>Geothermal heat pumps</h3>
          <div class="p1">
            <img src="geothermal.jpeg" alt="first image">
            <p style="padding-left: 4%;">Instead of using an air-source system, opt for a geothermal heat pump,
            which draws heat from the earth rather than the air.
            During hotter months, the ground below is cooler, and during cooler months, the
            ground is hotter, allowing your home to adjust
            to the temperature outside. This saves energy and is more friendly to the
            environment than an air source. There are different
            types of Geothermal heat pumps, for more information on the different types,
            click <a href="https://executivecooling.com/blog/types-geothermal-heat-
            pumps">here.</a>

          <h3>Install Insulation</h3>
          <div class="p1">
            <img src="insulation.jpeg" alt="2nd image">
            <p>This allows for resistance to cold air leaking into your home in the
            winter, and hot air in the summer. This will reduce
            energy bills as it keeps the hot air in and cold air out during winter, and
            vice versa in the summer. The amount of insulation
            you will need depends on the house you have and climate you reside in.
            Consulting a professional is a good course of action,
            click <a href="https://icaa.officialbuyersguide.net/">here</a> to find local
            contractors in your area for your home's needs.</p>
          </div>
          <h3>Solar panels</h3>
          <div class="p1">
            <img src="solar.jpeg" alt="3rd image">
            <p>Solar Panels convert sunlight into electrical energy, reducing
            emissions. Some roofs might not be equipped for solar panels,
            it's important to determine the size and shape of your roof and when it will
            be due for a replacement to see if your home is
            suitable for solar panels. Click <a href="https://www.angi.com/nearme/install-solar-panels/">here</a>
            to find solar installation companies near you. If your home isn't adequate,
            you can try community solar,
            which are projects that bring energy to multiple people. Click <a href="https://www.energysage.com/community-solar/">here</a>
            to see if a solar farm is near you.</p>

          <h3>Update Plumbing</h3>
          <div class="p1">
            <img src="watersense.jpeg" alt="4th image">
            <p>If your plumbing predates early 90s, then you could be wasting
            unnecessary water due to federal standards on water waste
            being different. Switching to a WaterSense labeled toilet, shower, or other
            plumbing fixture will stop water waste.

              No toxic chemicals or compounds are released with this fireplace, and
              they run on biofuel which is made by plant by-products.
              No ventilation is required for this fireplace because it doesn't release
